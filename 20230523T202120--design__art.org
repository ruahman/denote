If you can design one thing you can design everything

think of design as a problem solving discipline.

design is solving problem, not drawing pictures.

do not seek to follow the footsteps of the wise.
seek what they sought.

form does not always follow function.

form and function should be one.

Architecture begins where engineering ends.

Universal Principles of Design is a must have book.
