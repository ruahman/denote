 a novel framework aimed at enhancing
Bitcoin's scalability for cross-chain applications

By integrating customized channel factories,
Taproot, and a policy language

The necessity
for BitScaler arises from the challenge of implementing automated market makers
(AMM) on Bitcoin in conjunction with the Lightning Network (LN).

BitScaler introduces the ability to create multiple
peer-to-peer channels from a single on-chain transaction,

non-custodial delegation for facilitating Automated Market Makers (AMMs)???

By leveraging Taproot (BIP-341 2020) and policy language

Future
iterations will incorporate advanced features such as MuSig2 (Nick, Ruffing, and Seurin 2020),
FROST (Komlo and Goldberg 2020), DLCs (Dryja, n.d.), and Eltoo (Decker 2019), 

The Lightning Network (LN) (Poon and Dryja 2016) is a layer-2 (L2) solution designed to
economize on the cost and time involved in exchanging Bitcoin. It allows two peers to exchange
transactions off-chain, settling their balances on-chain only occasionally

To initiate an LN channel, an on-chain transaction is required, anchoring the channel with
funds contributed by the two peers, locked to a 2-of-2 multisig address. Off-chain transactions
are then exchanged privately between peers, by revoking old states (balances) and committing
to new states, without broadcasting to the Bitcoin blockchain.

When both peers agree, they can close the channel by signing a single on-chain transaction
reflecting the final state of the channel. This transaction summarizes and settles all off-chain
activity, releasing funds to each peer according to the agreed final state

Despite the efficiency of LN channels, opening and closing channels still incur on-chain costs &
confirmation cycles.

For example, the opening and the closing transactions of any one channel
are still on chain.

There are a number of situations
where we would like to open and close channels nimbly. For example, when desired liquidity
to one side or another is depleted, we may wish to rebalance some of our channels.

 We could
combine in one transaction the closing of one channel with the opening of another, with splicing


Channel factories allow for the creation and closure
of multiple channels from a single on-chain transaction

an initial on-chain transaction involving
these addresses. This is called a hook transaction

. From then on, they can create
and close channels amongst themselves, keeping each channelâ€™s transactions entirely off-chain,
including the transactions that fund these channels. The latter are called allocation transactions
and lie in L2

Each allocation transaction funds a number of channels, each channel through one of its UTXOs.

The transactions in each such channel are one layer up from the allocation transaction that
funds it.

If the participants cooperate, they may agree to rebalance the funds in their subchannels
by creating a new allocation transaction with an earlier timelock, both relative to the hook
transaction, using a sufficient time gap to allow the new transaction to be safely broadcast
before the old one. 

Strands of connected transactions in an invalidation tree are only valid within
that subtree with the earliest timelocks.
