deploy NPM packages with *Nix package manager*

- deploy NPM packages on NixOS

# installation

``` shell
nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA nodePackages.node2nix
```

# Usage

The primary use case of node2nix is to deploy a development project as a NPM package.

Running the following command generates a collection of Nix expressions from package.json:

``` shell
node2nix
```

The above command generates three files: node-packages.nix capturing the packages that can be deployed including all its required dependencies, node-env.nix contains the build logic and default.nix is a composition expression allowing users to deploy the package.

By running the following Nix command with these expressions, the project can be built:

``` shell
 nix-build -A package
```
