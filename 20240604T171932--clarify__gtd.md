# Clarify #

deside what action should be taken.
1. do it
2. put it in next actions
3. put it in somday-maybe
4. put it as a reference.
5. throw it away

go through each item in the inbox an decide if it is actionable
or should be stored as a reference


if it is actionable,
if you can do it under 2 minutes then just do it.

if not, put it in the next action list
define it.
define what done looks like
define what are the next steps to make this task doneb

if this is something that does not need to be done now,
put it in the someday-maybe file


if it is just a reference then put it 
in you PARA folder
