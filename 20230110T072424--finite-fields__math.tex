\section{finite field definition}
\label{sec:org78192f1}

a finite field is a finite set of number and two operations,(+,-) that satisfy the following

\begin{enumerate}
\item if a and b are in the set then, a + b and a * b are also in the set.
\begin{itemize}
\item this is called the \uline{closed} property
\item the results always stay inside the set
\end{itemize}

\item zero exists and has the propert a + 0 = a
\begin{itemize}
\item this is called the \uline{additive identity} property
\end{itemize}

\item 1 exitst and a * 1 = a
\begin{itemize}
\item this is called the \uline{multiplicative identity} property
\end{itemize}

\item if a is in the set and -a is in the set, then a - a = 0
\begin{itemize}
\item this is called the \uline{additive inverse} property
\end{itemize}

\item if a is in the set and is not 0, then \(a^{-1}\) is in the set that make \(a \cdot a^{-1} = 1\)
\begin{itemize}
\item this is called the \uline{multiplication inverse} property
\end{itemize}

\item the \uline{order} of the set size of numbers

\item in order to acceive the following properties we need to redefine additon and multiplication for the set.
\end{enumerate}

\section{defining finite sets}
\label{sec:org63cbff5}

if the order of the set is defined as p, then the elements of the set are \(\{0,1,2,\dots,p-1\}\)

\begin{itemize}
\item these are called elements of the set
\item notice that p is alway one more than its largist element
\item p is alway prime
\end{itemize}

\begin{align*}
F_p  &= \{0,1,2,\dots,p-1\}\\
F_{11} &= \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}
\end{align*}
