* Segwit
  <version> <witness program>
  - P2WSH = 34 bytes
  - P2WPKH = 22 bytes

  P2TR(bech32m)

* schnorr
  allows signature aggregation easy

  - you can aggregate the key need to spend a multisig


  
* MAST
  merkilized abstract sysntax tree

  you can hash together a bunch of script into a merkell tree,

  the merkell root gets transformed into the Taproot output which is P2TR

  just provide the signature need for one path the and rest of the hashes in the merkel tree and you can spend it.

  all script that use MAST look exactly the same
