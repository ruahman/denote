vite takes advantage of ES Modules and serves the directly to the browser.
- it's not rebundling everytime you make a change
- when there is a change only the module gets loaded
- web pack bundles everything together
  + every time there is a change everything gets rebundled
  

uses Rollup to bundle file for production (npm run build)

HMR (Hot Module Replacement)

you can setup a .env file and call it this way `import.meta.env.MY_ENV_VAR`

you can just start using sass by just `npm i sass` and vite will automatically compile sass file when you include them
- and when you want to run for production, sass will be compiled and shiped

to install tailwind
`npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`

then init tailwind
