nushell is a powerful data processing environment that also happens to be a shell.

it treats the output of all commands as structured data
filterd or transformed as needed

a basic pipline in nushell is in three sections
*<command_that_generate_data_for_pipline>| <filter_query_or_transform_data> | <output_data_in_stucture formate>*

`open` opens file into a table for the pipline

out put is in table and support pipes and queries  

`$env` show all environment variable

`ls | sort-by <column>`  sort display by column
`ls | sort-by <column> | reverse`  reverse display

`cat <file> | table` 
- output text to a table

`ps | where <condition>`  applly where clause

`<command> | save json`  save output as json

`<json_file> | get <key>`  get key from json output

`http get <url>`  comes with http query

`<command_that_outputs_text> | detect columns`  
- this detects columns and outputs them in a table structure 

`<command_that_outputs_json> | from json`
`<command_that_outputs_yaml> | from yaml`
`<command_that_outputs_text> | detect columns | to json`
- converts text to json
`<command_that_exports_huge_output> | explore`
- explore 

nushell can query other files
- toml
- yaml
- json
- csv
- ini
- sqlite
- etc???

you can do multiline commands like this
``` shell
(ls
∙ | where type == file
∙ | where size > 5b
∙ | reverse)
```
