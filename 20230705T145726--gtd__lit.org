* get it off your mind and into a system you can trust

** you brain is for having ideas not for holding them

** create a external / second brain

** harness appropriate engagement with the world

* GTD is broken down into 5 steps
  1. Capture
     - create an inbox where you collect ideas
     - caputure all the things you need to get done
     - caputere everyting that you need to get done or might be usful to you
     - get everything off your mind
  2. Clarify/Process
     - go through each item in inbox and decide if it is actionable?
       - if yes
	 - then if would it take less than two minutes to complete? then do it.
       - if not 
	 - put it in next action list
	   - clarify what does done look like and what are the next specific actions that need to be done
	 - or someday maybe file
	 - or as a reference.
  3. Organize
     - organize task according to project, time and context
  4. Review
     - at the end of the week review all your items and make adjustments where needed
     - go through your someday-maybe file to see if you can move any items over
     - dedicate to review so that you brain doesn't keep on bugging you to check
  5. Engage
     - do it

  write down something,
  define what done looks like,
  define what are the next steps to make this task done
  categories it an then schedule it.

* Notebook is my inbox

* Emacs is my action list

* OneNote if is ref

* LTP (Log Tag Plan) 

Capture, Clarify, Organize, Review, Execute

* Zero Inbox
  everything in your inbox has been processed, not nothing in your inbox


specify outcome and actions

Anxiety is cause by a lack of control, organization, preparation and action
