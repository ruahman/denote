* module arithmetic
one of the ways we can make finite fields closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
is by module arithmetic

we can define addition on a finite set using module arithmetic

7 % 3 = 1

- the module is the remander

  1747 % 241 = 60

- it helps to think of module arithmetic as a clock

- ex:
  what will be the time if now is 3:00 in 47 hours?

  (3 + 47) % 12 = 2

- ex:
  what was the time 16 hours ago?

  (3 - 16) % 12 = 11

- ex:
  what will be the time minutes from now?

  (12 + 843) % 60 = 15

- we will be using module arithmetic when defining finite field arithmetic
