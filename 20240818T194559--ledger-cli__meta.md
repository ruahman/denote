a ledger (a file containing a list of transactions for different accounts).

A valid transaction consists of 7 elements:

1. Date (with a YYYY/mm/dd format)
2. Vendor name on the same line as the date separated by a space
3. From Account name on a new line, indented with 4 spaces
4. From Account amount on the same line as the From Account name, separated by at least 2 spaces
5. To Account name on a new line, indented with 4 spaces
6. To Account amount on the same line as the To Account name, separated by at least 2 spaces

From Account and To Account amounts must add to 0

```
2019/12/14 Acme, Inc          # date, vendor name
    My Bank Account  -12.34   # from account
    My Expense Account  12.34 # to account
```

Ledger’s system relies on double entry accounting, 
meaning transactions always occur between two accounts. 

transactions are always between two accounts.
accounts are locations for your money

# Register Reports

Viewing a register, or a listing of transactions, 
can be as simple as running ledger -f sample.ledger register 
or ledger -f sample.ledger reg:

We can also view a register for a specific account by specifying the account name after the register command:
`ledger -f sample.ledger reg "My Bank Account"`

# Balance Reports

Similar to the register report, 
the balance report can be executed with the balance command: `ledger -f sample.ledger balance` 
or `ledger -f sample.ledger bal`.

* shows the totals for each account

Akin to the register report, you can specify the account name to the balance command to get the balance of a specific account:

# Specifying Time Periods (Months)

The period is specified with the -p flag after a report command (i.e. register and balance from what we’ve discussed) 
followed by a period query.

`ledger -f sample.ledger reg -p "dec"`

; This is a journal file
; A semi-colon is one way to create a comment

; 1.
; Below is a simple transaction.
; This transaction occurred on 2019/11/01
; The transaction details let us know that it is a withdrawal of cash from a saving account.
2019/11/01  WITHDRAWLING CASH
    assets:wallet     100.00
    assets:savings     -100.00

; 2.
; Here is another simple transaction.
; This transaction shows us paying 5.00 dollars for coffee from our wallet
2019/11/02 BUYING A BOOK
    expenses:reading   5.00
    assets:wallet     -5.00


; 3.
; This is a transaction showing what a paycheck might look like in ledger
; Note that we do not have to __explicitly__ balance this transaction to our income account
; Ledger will handle the balancing implicitly for this account when the balance ammount is ommitted.
2019/11/03 PAYCHECK
    assets:savings      130.00
    income

; 4.
; This is showing multiple transactions on the same date being implictly balanced
; Note that accounts can be as specific as you need them to be.
2019/11/04 LUNCH AND ICECREAM
    expenses:food:eating out      10.95
    expenses:food:icecream        4.15
    liabilities:creditcard


this will show the balance of each account in your ledger file
` ledger -f main.journal balance` 

show all the expensives accounts
` ledger -f main.journal balance ^expenses` 

if you want to see a line by line detail of all your transactions for expenses
`ledger -f main.journal register ^expenses`  

A checkbook journal records debits (subtractions, or withdrawals) and credits (additions, or deposits)

an account is where money comes from and where it goes.  

But in a general journal, you write postings in two lines: 
the source account and target account.
There must always be a debit from at least one account for every credit made to another account. 
This is what is meant by “double-entry” accounting: 
the journal must always balance to zero, with an equal number of debits and credits. 

money never pops in or out of existence; it is always a posting from one account to another. 

An account is anywhere money can go.

# Reports

To find the balances of all of your accounts, run this command:

`ledger -f drewr3.dat balance`

Showing you the balance of all accounts. 
Options and search terms can pare this down to show only the accounts you want.
